              SoulCedar Farm is committed to operating with the earth in mind.
              Healthy farming has the ability to feed not only human beings, but
              all those who participate in the growth cycle; strong soil fosters
              flowers, flowers perpetuate pollinators, pollinators enable
              fruiting, fruiting feeds, feeding fertilizes. The cycle begets
              itself. Sustainable agriculture is not possible if farming
              practices neglect any of these essential elements.
